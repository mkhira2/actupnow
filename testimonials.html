      <blockquote>“Hands down best investment in my business ever! The course paid for itself in just a few months. David’s business coaching was incredibly personal and his approach is not like anything I had ever even hear of before. Now I have the knowledge and confidence to book shows and keep clients coming back again and again. I recouped my investment above and beyond my present bookings in just three months. This will be the best decision you’ll ever make and you’ll be thanking yourself for doing it. Grab the opportunity while you can because people like David who are willing to share don’t come around everyday.”<footer>-Mike T</footer></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><br />

      <blockquote>“I felt like I’d spent my whole life learning magic and honing my performance skills to make a living and support my family doing what I love, but it just wasn’t happening. I’d spent A LOT of time and A LOT of money buying books, effects, presentations, learning lines, writing patter and story lines, and my show was good. However, I only had a small handful of customers, and little to no repeat bookings. I felt like a fisherman, with all the best equipment, one of the nicest boats, but no lake. Then it hit me. After years of working on the show, I had neglected to learn the business side of “show business.” Luckily I had the good fortune to meet David Hira. David is one of those rare individuals who makes a VERY good living as a professional magician, because in addition to having a great show he understands the business side of show business (and business in general). What makes him even more rare is he is a fantastic teacher. What makes him exceptional is he’s willing to teach you EVERYTHING he knows if you are willing to listen. I was.<br /><br />

      Now I’m a full-time corporate entertainer charging the 4 figure rates I’d always wanted to, my clients are reaching out two years in advance to book me, and the financial struggles my wife and I had are gone. What’s more amazing is I’m not even done implementing all the things David taught me! Studying with David is a once in a lifetime opportunity that will pay for itself VERY quickly if you apply the lessons he teaches to your career (it took me less than 3 months). He’s an incredible mentor, a great guy, and a true friend. I can’t recommend studying with him highly enough. Thank you David!”<footer>-Ben W.</footer></blockquote><br /><br /><br /><br />

      <blockquote>“My Dad had always advised me to surround myself with the most knowledgeable, seasoned, and generous individuals that would be willing to counsel me. No one fits that description better than David Hira. David’s breadth of experience and genuine vested interest in my success makes me proud to say that I’m an ‘apprentice’ of his business mentorship.<br /><br />

      While some magicians fixate on the latest wrinkle to their second deal, I know that I’m getting “the real work” on negotiations, client relationships, and growing my business year after year. If you want to take your magic and turn it into a viable vocation, my advice to you is simple: sit down, take notes, and learn from the best: David Hira.”<footer>-Ben J.</footer></blockquote>

      <blockquote>“In some ways I don’t know if my performances this last week improved because of the tools that I learned, or because of a renewed change in attitude about what I do and how I see my audiences and my clients. In any case, it’s a change for the better, because I’ve done a much better job connecting with my audiences, and it’s shown not only in the responses I’ve gotten during my performances, but in the things people have said to me after my performances. People have come up to me with tears in their eyes, thanking me for the wonderful experience. It doesn’t get much better than that.”<footer>-Lou S.</footer></blockquote>

      <blockquote>“Thank you, from the bottom of my heart. I’ve been floundering, and you both helped give me knowledge, direction, and most of all hope that I can make the changes I need to make in my business, life, and relationships. Having you two as role models for success makes it so much easier. Thank you for everything, and I’ll try to pay back your generosity by being the most successful business as I can possibly be!”<footer>-Jonathan P.</footer></blockquote>

      <blockquote>“The training was amazing. We learned so much and you’ve given us a roadmap on where to go and how to take our business. The information was priceless. Thank you both!”<footer>-Sonu V.</footer></blockquote>
