		<h3>You are a terrific magician! You know your stuff and have performed proficiently for a number of years. You’ve made money at magic and have done a good job. But you seem to be “out of a job” at the end of every show. You spend lots of time pitching yourself to event planners, but you aren’t really making it yet. You’ve talked to other magicians, gone to all the conventions and maybe even a workshop or two. You are frustrated because you know you are capable of making it big, but you aren’t getting much traction and the information you’ve received up until now just isn’t working for you. No one seems to really know how to help you. And you don’t know where to get the help you need.</h3>

You’ll get all of David’s present contracts, invoices, and learn all about important thank yous and follow up.</li>
			<li>You’ll get 40 years of experience of mistakes and successes in just under a week.</li>
			<li>You’ll get all the show-biz tips, tricks, hints, clues, and pointers that usually only come from a lifetime in business and on stage.</li>
